We were tasked with creating a simple web layout, utilizing the resources given to us for the homework. A landing page was created with a bootstrap header for quick links.
Each visualization page was linked to by the landing page with each image being selectable as a link. 
Each visualization was to have its own page with a descriptive tiel and heading page. 

Finally this was all to be deployed to github pages.
